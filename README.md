**medit** is a lightweight, feature-rich text editor designed for programming and everyday text editing. Built on GTK, it provides a clean, fast editing experience with powerful features including split views, an integrated terminal, plugin support, and extensive customization options.


## What's New in 1.8.x (GTK3 Branch)

The 1.8.x series represents a major modernization of medit:

1. **GTK2 → GTK3 migration** — modern widget toolkit with better HiDPI support
2. **Python 2 → Python 3** — updated plugin system for current Python
3. **C++ libvte terminal** — replaces the old Python-based VTE terminal
4. **Split terminal panels** — multiple terminal sessions in the terminal pane
5. **Fast long-line loading** — visual truncation with progressive reveal for files with very long lines
6. **Column/box selection** — `Ctrl+drag` rectangular selection with full copy/paste support
7. **Toggle matching bracket** — `Ctrl+]` to jump between a bracket and its match
8. **Ctrl+scroll font zoom** — increase/decrease the editor notebook font size
9. **Code folding** — collapse/expand blocks for curly-bracket languages (C/C++/Java/JS), `end`-keyword languages (Ruby/Pascal/Matlab/Octave), and indentation-based languages (Python)
10. **Indentation shortcuts** — `Ctrl+9` to indent / `Ctrl+0` to unindent selected text by one space
11. **Breadcrumb folder navigation** — clickable path bar in the file selector for fast directory traversal
12. **CMake build support** — build with either Autotools or CMake
13. **Customizable color themes** — extended theme and terminal color scheme support
14. **Numerous bug fixes** and performance improvements


## Features

### Core Editing
- **Syntax highlighting** for 100+ programming and markup languages (via GtkSourceView)
- **Multiple documents** with tabbed interface
- **Split views** — view the same or different files side by side
- **Split notebooks** — independent tab groups for flexible layouts
- **Line numbers**, current line highlighting, and right margin indicator
- **Bracket matching** with highlight; `Ctrl+]` toggles between a bracket and its match
- **Bookmarks** — set, navigate, and manage bookmarks across documents
- **Code folding** — collapse/expand code blocks with margin glyphs; supports curly-bracket languages (C/C++/Java/JavaScript/etc.), `end`-keyword languages (Ruby/Pascal/Matlab/Octave), and indentation-based languages (Python)
- **Indentation adjustment** — `Ctrl+9` / `Ctrl+0` to indent or unindent selected lines by one space
- **Configurable word wrap** — none, character, or word boundaries
- **Undo/Redo** with unlimited history

### Column (Box) Selection
- **Ctrl+click+drag** to select a rectangular block of text
- Per-character highlight using the theme selection color
- **Copy** column-selected text (`Ctrl+C`)
- **Paste** column text at cursor position — inserts per-line at the cursor column
- **Paste into box selection** — replaces the selected rectangle with pasted block
- Full Unicode support for column operations

### Code Folding

medit supports folding code blocks directly in the editor margin:

- **Curly-bracket languages** (C, C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.) — folds `{...}` blocks
- **`end`-keyword languages** (Ruby, Pascal, Matlab, Octave) — folds `begin...end`, `if...end`, `for...end`, and similar constructs
- **Indentation-based languages** (Python) — folds blocks defined by consistent indentation
- Click the **fold glyph** (`▾`/`▸`) in the left margin to collapse or expand a block
- Folded regions are visually indicated; inner folds are preserved when a parent is collapsed
- Syntax highlighting and long-line handling remain active for folded content

### Long Line Handling
- **Fast loading** of files with very long lines (thousands of characters)
- Lines beyond 4096 characters are visually truncated with a `...` indicator
- **Click the `...` marker** to progressively reveal 4096 more characters
- Full line content preserved in buffer — copy/paste and save work on complete text
- Long-line truncation applies automatically to pasted text in new documents

### Font Zoom
- **Ctrl+Scroll wheel** to increase/decrease the editor notebook font size
- Temporary zoom — does not affect global preferences
- Supports both discrete scroll wheel and smooth trackpad scrolling
- Font size range: 4 pt – 72 pt

### Integrated Terminal
- **Built-in terminal** panel (C++ libvte-based)
- **Split terminal panels** — run multiple independent terminal sessions
- Terminal tracks the current file's directory automatically
- **Multiple color schemes** — Default, Black on White, Green on Black, VIM Colors, and more

### Symbol Browser (Ctags)
- **Symbol browser panel** — lists functions, classes, and variables in the active document
- Powered by **ctags** for accurate symbol extraction across many languages
- Click any symbol to jump to its definition line
- Tree view auto-refreshes when switching documents

### Find in Files
- **Multi-file search** — grep-like search across a directory tree
- Supports **regular expressions** and file pattern filters
- Automatically skips VCS directories (`.git/`, `.svn/`, `.hg/`, `CVS/`)
- Results listed in a panel with one-click jump to matching line

### File Management
- **File selector panel** — browse and open files from a sidebar tree with **breadcrumb navigation bar** for quickly jumping up the folder hierarchy
- **File list panel** — quick access to open documents
- **File filters** — configurable patterns to show/hide files in the selector
- **Recent files** list with history
- **Session support** — save and restore open documents and window layout
- **File group support** — organize files into logical groups

### Extensibility
- **Python 3 plugin support**
- **Lua scripting** support
- **Configurable command-line tools** — run external commands from the editor
- **Custom actions** with keyboard shortcuts

### Customization
- **Configurable color themes** with multiple built-in schemes
- **Keyboard shortcut editor** — remap any command in Preferences
- **Per-language settings** — tab width, indentation style, word characters
- **Configurable encoding** detection and conversion
