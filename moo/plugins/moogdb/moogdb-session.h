/*

 *   Public API for the MooGdbSession GObject — a thin wrapper around
 *   a `gdb --interpreter=mi3` subprocess.  Phase 1 (commit 1) only
 *   exposes the spawn-and-quit lifecycle plus a `-gdb-version`
 *   round-trip; execution control, breakpoints, and frame inspection
 *   land in subsequent commits.
